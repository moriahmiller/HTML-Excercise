				I have seven pets in total. Back home, I have five dogs. Murphy, who is a yellow lab, Holly and Onslow are both Basset Hounds, Lola is an Old English Sheepdog, and Emy is an Old English Bulldog. Murphy is the oldest and Emy is the youngest that my parents got almost a year ago. Here in Omaha I have a cat named Bentley, a hamster named Squirt, and a Betta fish named Theo. You could say I am quite an animal person.
